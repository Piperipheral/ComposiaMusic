A Thesis By William Karunia (001201600001)
------

This is a python GUI along with a pre-trained Autoencoder model [trained using this code](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LWERpMD2wCbbixl2Ni27XPtp0wg5n0-9?authuser=2) intended to be used by music composers in order to generate prompts to be used as ideas or starting points music compositions.

*Requirements*

Users should have python 3.5 (3.7 was used during development) or later installed in their system.
The packages required for the application to run:
1. [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install)
2. [Keras](https://keras.io/)
3. [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html)
4. [numpy](https://numpy.org/install/)
5. [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted)
6. [pyaudio](https://pypi.org/project/PyAudio/)
7. [midiutil](https://pypi.org/project/MIDIUtil/)

It is recommended that user uses a virtual environment when installing the packages and attempting to run the python script.
